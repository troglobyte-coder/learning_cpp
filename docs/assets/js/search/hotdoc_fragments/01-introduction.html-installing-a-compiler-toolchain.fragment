It has imperative, object-oriented and\ngeneric programming features.\nC++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.\nBefore we start programming with C++. We will need an environment to\nbe set-up on our local host system to compile and run our C++ programs\nsuccessfully.\nFor setting up your own personal development environment on your\nlocal machine you need to install three important software tools:\nText Editor: Text Editors are type of programs used to edit or write\ntexts. We will use text-editors to type our C++ programs. The normal\nextension of a text file is (.txt) but a text file containing C++\nprogram should be saved with .cpp or .cc extension. Files ending\nwith the extension .cpp and .cc are called source code files and\nthey are supposed to contain source code written in the C++ programming\nlanguage. These extension helps the compiler to identify that the\nfile contains a C++ program.\nBefore we write with C++, one must have a text-editor installed so we can\nwrite programs.\nMeson build system: Meson is an open source build system meant to be\nboth extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.\nThe main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing\nor debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every second spent\nwaiting for the build system to actually start compiling code. Plus it's easy\nfor you to focus on the samples in this notebook.\nC++ Compiler: Once you have installed text-editor and typed and save\nyour program in a file with .cpp extension, you will need a C++\ncompiler to compile this file. A compiler is a computer program which\nconverts high-level language into machine understandable low-level\nlanguage. In other words, we can say that it converts the source code\nwritten in a programming language into another computer language which\nthe computer understands. For compiling a C++ program we will need a\nC++ compiler which will convert the source code written in C++ into\nmachine codes. Below are the details about setting up compiler on\ndifferent platforms.\nLinux Installation: If you're using a Linux host system we will be\ninstall the GNU GCC compiler and Meson build system. To install and\nwork with the GCC compiler and Meson build on your Linux machine, proceed\naccording to below steps for you Linux OS.\n"});
